# Objective
# In this challenge, you will work with arithmetic operators. 

# Task
# Given the meal price (base cost of a meal), tip percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tip), and tax percent (the percentage of the meal price being added as tax) for a meal, find and print the meal's total cost. Round the result to the nearest integer.

# The function accepts following parameters:
#  1. DOUBLE meal_cost
#  2. INTEGER tip_percent
#  3. INTEGER tax_percent

    tax_cost = meal_cost * (tax_percent / 100)
    meal_final = meal_cost + tip_cost + tax_cost
