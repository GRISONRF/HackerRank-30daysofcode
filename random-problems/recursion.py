""" Find the index of an item in a list usin recursion.
Given a list of items: ["hey", "there", "you"]
You should write a recursive function that takes a list of items and the item
 to search for, and returns the index of the item in the list, or a -1 if the
 item is not in the list.

For example, in the above list, the index of "there" is '1' and the index of
 "where" is -1.

Please solve this problem using recursion only, no loops. """


def recursive(items, item):

    #base case -> when item is found/not found


    #recursive call -> 


    pass
print(recursive(["hey", "there", "you"], "there"))
