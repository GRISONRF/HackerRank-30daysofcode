""" An array of length N is given.
1 <= N <= 21e5

In one operation you can add two adjacent numbers together
Eg:
1, 4, 2, 5 --> 1, 6, 5
Elements at index 1 and 2 are combined.
You can perform any number of operations.

The array needs to be made non-decreasing. Find the maximum length of the array such that it is non-decreasing.

Sample Input #1
6
5 1 6 7 8 2
Sample Output #1
4

( Array can be 5, 7, 7, 10 or 6, 6, 7, 10 whose length is 4 ) """
