""" /* You have a single collection of data, which contains collections of strings,
 including contestant name, marathon event name, and final position.
 Using this data, write a function that logs a 2-line string for each pair of contestants,
 showing each contestantâ€™s average position amongst all shared events.

####in this example they only have one race against each other, so we just return their positions as it is:
input : [
 ["Billy Blue", "Boston Marathon","76"]
 ["Billy Blue", "New York Marathon", "89"]
 ["Perry Pink", "Boston Marathon", "23"]
 ["Gerald Green", "New York Marathon", "4"]
]

output: "Billy Blue: 76"
"Perry Pink: 23"

"Billy Blue: 89"
"Gerald Green: 4"


##### is this case,  you will notice that contestants might have competed in multiple events with each other. Those positions should be averaged out. The purpose is to find the average finishing position of both contestants in all the events they share with each other. example: Billy Blue and Gerald Green have two marathons in common, the Dallas Marathon and the New York Marathon. Billy Blue finished 89th and 74th in those events, averaging to 81.5, 81 after rounding. Gerald Green finished 4th and 81th in those events, averaging 11th.
